# About

My name is Nick Biederman. I started Simple Circuits Modular as a way to share my Synth DIY designs with the world. My main focus has always been on sharing my work openly so others can build off of it. Every circuit board, schematic, or piece of code I create is uploaded publically to my GitHub. I encourage you to build these modules yourself, improve my designs, and share your own designs with the world. A link to my GitHub can be found below and each product page has a direct link to the repository for that module.

All the information you need to build these modules yourself has been made avaliable, but I understand that some people prefer to purchase a fully assembaled module. In my Reverb store, you'll find fully assemballed and tested modules as well as circuit boards for many of my designs. Every module is assemballed by hand in my apartment and feature an acrylic panels. Below is a link to my Reverb storefront.

Though most of the electronic design and coding has been done by myself, I have chosen to work with a close friend for most of my panel design. With the exception of a few particularly crowded panels, all of the panel designs have been done by Laura Lenhart. I've linked her industrial design portfolio below.
