# Modules

Every module is released under CC Attrubution Share Alike 4.0. With this licesne, anyone is free to build, sell, or modify these designs as long as they share any changes they make under the same license.

I'm currently in the process of fully documenting each module and transferring ownership from my personal GitHub to the Simple Circuits Modular orginazation. 

## [Master Clock](https://github.com/simplecircuitsmodular/Master-Clock)

This module packs a bunch of clock utilities into one small package. The large arcade button makes it easy to set the tempo with the tap of your finger. An external clock input allows the module to function as a traditional clock multiplier and divider. The rate knob has two modes. In mode 1, it modifies the base clock rate allowing you to speed up or slow down the tempo of an external clock or tap tempo. In mode 2 the knob sets the clock rate directly.

# About

My name is Nick Biederman. I started Simple Circuits Modular as a way to share my Synth DIY designs with the world. My main focus has always been on sharing my work openly so others can build off of it. Every circuit board, schematic, or piece of code I create is uploaded publically to my GitHub. I encourage you to build these modules yourself, improve my designs, and share your own designs with the world. A link to my GitHub can be found below and each product page has a direct link to the repository for that module.

All the information you need to build these modules yourself has been made avaliable, but I understand that some people prefer to purchase a fully assembaled module. In my Reverb store, you'll find fully assemballed and tested modules as well as circuit boards for many of my designs. Every module is assemballed by hand in my apartment and feature an acrylic panels. Below is a link to my Reverb storefront.

Though most of the electronic design and coding has been done by myself, I have chosen to work with a close friend for most of my panel design. With the exception of a few particularly crowded panels, all of the panel designs have been done by Laura Lenhart. I've linked her industrial design portfolio below.
