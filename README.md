## Modules

Every module is released under CC Attribution Share Alike 4.0. With this license, anyone is free to build, sell, or modify these designs as long as they share any changes they make under the same license.

I'm currently in the process of fully documenting each module and transferring ownership from my personal GitHub to the Simple Circuits Modular organization. 

### Stable

Currently none of these modules meet the standard I would like to consider them stable.

### In Development

#### [Master Clock](https://simplecircuitsmodular.github.io/masterClock/)

This module packs a bunch of clock utilities into one small package. The large arcade button makes it easy to set the tempo with the tap of your finger. An external clock input allows the module to function as a traditional clock multiplier and divider. The rate knob has two modes. In mode 1, it modifies the base clock rate allowing you to speed up or slow down the tempo of an external clock or tap tempo. In mode 2 the knob sets the clock rate directly.

#### [Drums](https://simplecircuitsmodular.github.io/drums/)

Two ATMega based drum modules offer a simple, low power draw method to add some drums to your rack. Both modules use the same board, but have different panels and code loaded onto them.

#### [Drone](https://simplecircuitsmodular.github.io/drone/)

These two modules are the only pure analog modules I've designed so far. Based on a reverse avalanche transistor oscillator, these modules offer a saw wave drone with built in passive filtering. The slave module features 3 oscillators and a tone control while the master features 2 oscillators, tone control, a passive mixer, and amplifier with volume control.

#### [Arcade Sequencer](https://simplecircuitsmodular.github.io/bads/)

This module offers a 6 channel drum sequencer with 3-64 steps. Each function is mapped to a single piece of hardware, and it can be synced to an internal or external clock. An additional set of jacks allows this module to record other trigger sources for playback as well.

## About

My name is Nick Biederman. I started Simple Circuits Modular to share my Synth DIY designs with the world. My focus has always been on sharing my work openly so others can build from it. Every circuit board, schematic, or piece of code I create is uploaded publicly to Simple Circuits Modular's GitHub. I encourage you to build these modules yourself, improve my designs, and share your own designs with the world. This website is hosted through GitHub, and each module page has a link directly to the repository.

All the information you need to build these modules yourself has been made available, but I understand that some people prefer to purchase panels, PCBs, or complete modules. If you'd like to purchase PCBs or panels, you can see what I currently have in stock on ay my Reverb page linked below. If you're looking for a panel I don't have listed or a complete module you can contact me below. 

Though most of the electronic design and coding has been done by myself, I have chosen to work with a close friend for most of my panel design. Except for a few particularly crowded panels, all the panel designs have been done by Laura Lenhart.

## For Sale

I do intend to offer panels and PCBs through Reverb as each module reaches a stable state. Until then, I'll be selling working development PCBs for $3 each plus shipping (basically just enough that I won't take too much of a hit on the next version if I sell them all). If you choose to order development boards, you'll receive something that is fully functional but has minor issues. Maybe a silk screen didn't turn out right or a component was placed on the wrong side of the board making it inconvenient to assemble, but functionally the module is complete. I'll include detailed instructions on how to work around these issues if you choose to buy a board that's in development. Send me an email with the contact link below if you'd like to order.

## Get Involved

If you want to help in the development of these modules, you can buy some boards and build a module in development for testing, help with code refactoring, or fix some of the issues reported on GitHub. If you have an idea for a module or a design of your own you'd like to share through Simple Circuits we can make that happen. I've made a slack group for development, you can follow [this invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/simplecircuitsmodular/shared_invite/enQtNDA2MjA1NTI0Njk0LTMwMDQ2Y2NkZjU1NGY2YmE0NDJjZDY1YjA2ZmY0MzNmNGMyMjNjNDM0MTk4MjRjYWIxNmI4ZWFiYjZjYzUwMjU) to join.
